## What is this?

Sylvinite is a library for working with hashed and plain-text passwords. It is written with the intent of easily replacing libraries such as `scrypt`, `password`, and `cryptonite` where applicable. 

## What're the goals of this project?

- Completely replace the functionality of the `scrypt` package.
- Provide a simple API for using all password hashing algorithms within libsodium.
- Document literally everything.

## How do I use this?

You can't use this at the moment. It's not done yet.

## What does this run on?

Windows, MacOS, and Linux. GHC 8.10.7+

## What can I do with this?

Hash passwords like you've always wanted.
